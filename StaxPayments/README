This code is written by Basker Mathrubootham for a sample C++ code for Stax payments

This is a simple list. For want of time, the code is brief, tested and verified
List.h contains the List class and the associated utility classes. The classes are documented as and when appropriate in List.h
The unit test methods are defined in ListUT.cpp.
Since I do not have a windows environment set up for development, all code was written on Linux and tested.

"make clean all" on Linux should clean and compile and link.
All code is original.

Unit Test output is written for your convenience.
To run the Unit test, run ListUT executable.
